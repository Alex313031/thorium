# Thorium SSE4.2

This directory contains build config files for compiling Thorium/Chromium with [SSE4.2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4#SSE4.2).

SSE4.2 is used to target 1st Gen core i series systems at a minimum.

I make SSE4.2 builds occasionally, since @midzer has a laptop with a 1st gen "Westmere" CPU.
