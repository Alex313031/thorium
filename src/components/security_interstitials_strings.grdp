    &lt;h4&gt;Step 1: Sign in to the portal&lt;/h4&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Go to any website starting with &lt;code&gt;http://&lt;/code&gt;, like &lt;a href="http://example.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://example.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;On the sign-in page that opens, sign in to use the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Step 2: Open the page in Incognito mode (computer only)&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open the page you were visiting in an Incognito window.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the page opens, a Thorium extension isn't working right. To fix the error, turn off the extension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Step 3: Update your operating system&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make sure your device is up-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Step 4: Temporarily turn off your antivirus&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You'll see this error if you have antivirus software that provides "HTTPS protection" or "HTTPS scanning." The antivirus is preventing Thorium from providing security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To fix the problem, turn off your antivirus software. If the page works after turning off the software, turn off this software when you use secure sites.&lt;/p&gt;
