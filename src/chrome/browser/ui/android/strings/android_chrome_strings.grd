<!-- android_chrome_strings.grd contains strings for Thorium for Android.

FAQ:
  - How do I add, change, or remove a string?
      Just update this file.
  - Translations will happen automatically??
      Yes, indeed. Just add your string before the branch point and
      make the description good.
  - Tell me more, please?
      Ok: http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/ui-localization

CHAR_LIMIT guidelines:
  Certain strings need character limits to prevent a long translation from breaking the UI.
  Translators will ensure the translation fits within the limit, but may be forced to use odd
  abbreviations to do so. There is a tradeoff here, so only use character limits when they're
  necessary.

  For example, a main menu item needs a character limit because the menu item can't wrap, so a long
  translation will be cut off. On the other hand, an error message that can wrap over multiple lines
  doesn't need a limit.

  * Most strings - No limit. Omit "[CHAR_LIMIT=...]" altogether.
  * Main menu items - 27, or 24 characters if it has a checkbox
  * Settings headers - 32 characters
  * Settings items - 32 characters
  * Half-screen buttons - 20 characters
  * Context menu items - 30 characters
  * Action bar items - 32 characters

For example, some websites may respond to this request by showing you ads that aren’t based on other websites you’ve visited.
