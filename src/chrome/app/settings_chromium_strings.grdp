  <message name="IDS_SETTINGS_PRIVACY_SANDBOX_AD_PERSONALIZATION_DIALOG_DESCRIPTION_LISTS_EMPTY" desc="A paragraph beneath the card title. Note that this paragraph is written so that it describes both the Topics API and the FLEDGE API. Some things are described slightly differently for this reason. Version 3 of 3 of this paragraph.  1) NOT THE CASE FOR THIS STRING: A different version of this first line is written for the case that a user has Privacy Sandbox trials turned on AND that they’ve been randomly selected for a trial. 2) NOT THE CASE FOR THIS STRING: A different version of  this first line is written for the case that a user has the Privacy Sandbox trials turned on but they haven’t been randomly selected to be in a trial. 3) The first line is written with the assumption that the user a) doesn’t have Privacy Sandbox trials turned on. b) Because of this, they can’t be randomly selected for a trial. This explains why the user doesn’t have data shown on the page. * “browsing history”:  “a record of sites you’ve visited using Thorium on this device.” * “affects the ads you see and the interests as estimated below”: browsing history leads to Thorium establishing user interests leads to 1) the ads you see are different, and 2) the list of things on this page changes based on what Thorium establishes. * “To protect your privacy”: Today, most data is kept for long periods of time. This new Topics API doesn’t retain estimated topics for more than 3 weeks. The only reason for this feature is to protect the user’s privacy. * “auto”: isn’t strictly necessary, but it conveys that this feature is an ongoing part of the service. This isn’t describing, for example, a one-time deletion. * “rolling basis each month”: Information associated with Topics and FLEDGE are deleted on a rolling basis at least once per month. It’s simpler to talk about “once per month” rather than 3 weeks for Topics and 4 weeks for FLEDGE. * “Interests can refresh…”: We intend for this line to cover both Topics and FLEDGE. It’s slightly messy, because there is a suggestion that this line is more about Topics than FLEDGE (“interests” is more prominent in the Topics subtitle).">
    If Thorium has randomly placed you in an active trial, your browsing history affects the ads you see and the interests as estimated below. To protect your privacy, Thorium deletes your interests on a rolling basis each month. Interests refresh unless you remove them.
