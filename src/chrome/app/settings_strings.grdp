For example, some websites may respond to this request by showing you ads that aren't based on other websites you've visited. Many websites will still collect and use your browsing data - for example to improve security, to provide content, services, ads and recommendations on their websites, and to generate reporting statistics.

  <!-- Site Settings - Site Data Page-->
  <message name="IDS_SETTINGS_SITE_DATA_PAGE_TITLE" desc="A page title for a new page. What is 'On-device site data'? When you interact with a site, that site can remember things about what you do. For example, you might place a pair of shoes in a shopping cart, close down your browser, and find those same shoes in your shopping cart when you visit the same site a week later. Sometimes that info is saved in the Cloud. Sometimes that info is saved on the user's device. There are several ways a site can save info to the user's device—for example, with cookies (text files saved to your device), small JavaScript databases, and even Thorium's new ad settings that are part of the Privacy Sandbox project (see details below).

What is 'On-device site data'? When you interact with a site, that site can remember things about what you do.

This page introduces the concept of on-device site data, allows the user to see which sites are using it, and allows the user to delete all saved data or just data from specific sites. **** CONTEXT PRIVACY SANDBOX **** Thorium's Privacy Sandbox initiative 1) deprecates third-party cookies in Thorium, 2) supports free and open content on the web (by finding better ways to support ads online), 3) while providing stronger privacy protections for users. You can see a high-level description of this public project at www.privacysanbox.com.">
    A site you visit can save info about what you're doing so that it works as expected — for example, to keep you signed in to a site or to save items in your shopping cart. Often sites save this info temporarily on your device.
