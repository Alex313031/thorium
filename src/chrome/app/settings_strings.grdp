It’s not just viewing a site but also how you interact with it, like by signing in * “Later”:  is important to convey the passage of time. We don’t want to convey how much time (it could be tiny). What’s important is that the user understands this is essentially a two-step process. A private state token is issued. Sometime in the future, when you visit a different site, that private state token might get used.">
    Based on your interaction with a site, like regularly signing in to an account, that site can issue a private state token to your browser. Later, if other sites you visit check for and find a valid private state token, they're more likely to treat you like a person and not a bot.
