"""Usage: find_patches.py [origin_branch] [> patch_file]

This will find all changes in |origin_branch| that are not part of upstream,
and print a report.  It tries to include deleted lines, though these are
heuristic at best.  If |origin_branch| is omitted, it will default to HEAD.

Changes in the working directory are ignored.

Output will be written to stdout, so you probably want to redirect it.

For example, to generate the patches file for origin/merge-m68:
find_patches.py origin/merge-m68 > patches.68

    can be ignored as noise.  While, with perfect deleted line tracking,
    this wouldn't actually change the result, we really just do a text
    search for deleted lines later.  So, avoiding noise is good.

    Note that this is approximate -- a diff could have deleted and
    inserted lines near each other, but from different patches.  In other
    words, patch A could delete lines and patch B could add / change them.
    If those changes end up in the same diff block, then we'll miss A
    because of this test.  However, in practice, checking for both seems
    to remove some noise.

    of the missing lines are interesting.  The whole file is gone, and it'll
    be handled specially elsewhere, rather than trying to 'git blame' specific
