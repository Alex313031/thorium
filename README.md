# Thorium

<img src="https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/logos/NEW/thorium_ver_2048_grey_old.png">

## Chromium fork for linux named after [radioactive element No. 90](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium). Windows/MacOS/RasPi/Android/Other builds see below.

- Always built with the latest stable version of [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/).
- Intended to behave like and have the featureset of Google Chrome, with differences/patches/enhancements listed below.
- Includes [Widevine](https://www.widevine.com/), [All Codecs](https://tools.woolyss.com/html5-audio-video-tester/), Chrome Plugins, as well as thinLTO, CFlag, LDFlag, LLVM Loop, and PGO compiler optimizations. It is built with [SSE4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4), [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions), and [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set), so it won't launch on CPU's below 2nd gen Core or AMD FX, but benefits from Advanced Vector EXtensions. If your CPU lacks AVX, you can use builds from the [Thorium SSE3](https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium-SSE3) repo.

> - Logo and Branding/Naming changed to the Thorium logo, Thorium name, and "Alex313031" being appended to "The Chromium Authors" in credits, etc.
> - .desktop file includes useful cmdline flags that enable experimental or useful features. (See [PATCHES.md](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/infra/PATCHES.md))
> - Includes installer patches and files to include [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/home) and *thorium_shell* [(content_shell)](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/docs/testing/web_tests_in_content_shell.md), with a .desktop file being provided for thorium_shell (named thorium-shell.desktop and shows in desktop environments as Thorium Content Shell). These are also included in the Windows releases, but it doesn't make a shorcut, although a .png and .ico is in the install directory for you to make your own shortcut with an icon. You can also run content_shell with the command thorium-shell (custom wrapper for it, located in /usr/bin/). You can run ChromeDriver at /usr/bin/chromedriver or chromedriver.exe on Windows. Also, patches for abseil library and mini_installer when building with AVX on Windows.
> - Right clicking the launcher after install gives three additional desktop actions, one to open thorium-shell, another to open in Safe Mode which disables any flags one has set in chrome://flags until the next launch, and lastly to open in Dark Mode which appends the --force-dark-mode flag.

- Known bugs are in the [BUGS.md](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/infra/BUGS.md) file.
