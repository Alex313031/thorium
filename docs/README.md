## Thorium Docs &nbsp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alex313031/Thorium/main/logos/NEW/patches.png" width="32">

Documentation about building Thorium, and related stuff like gn args and releases.

__I've also made some pages on the thorium.rocks website relating to Thorium development.__

 - There is a developer page [Here](https://thorium.rocks/dev), with links to different tools developers would find useful.
 - There is also the [documentation page](https://thorium.rocks/docs/), which has html copies of things in here as well as some things not in here. Recommended to use these instead.
 - *NOTE:* The .txt instructions are old, and only included for posterity, please use the .md instructions.
