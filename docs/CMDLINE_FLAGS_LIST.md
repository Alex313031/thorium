## There are many command line flags which can be used with Chromium. Some change behavior or features, others are for debugging or experimenting. This page lists the available switches including their conditions and descriptions.

Hint: On Linux, modify `~/.config/thorium/thorium-flags.conf` instead of `~/.config/thorium-flags.conf` or `~/.config/chromium-flags.conf`. 

Format: Condition ## Explanation ##
-----------------------------------

--/prefetch:1[1] ##	/prefetch:# arguments to use when launching various process types. It has been observed that when file reads are consistent for 3 process launches with the same /prefetch:# argument, the Windows prefetcher starts issuing reads in batch at process launch. Because reads depend on the process type, the prefetcher wouldn't be able to observe consistent reads if no /prefetch:# arguments were used. Note that the browser process has no /prefetch:# argument; as such all other processes must have one in order to avoid polluting its profile. Note: # must always be in [1, 8]; otherwise it is ignored by the Windows prefetcher. ##

--/prefetch:2[1] ##	No description ##

--/prefetch:3[1] ##	No description ##

--/prefetch:4[1] ##	No description ##

--/prefetch:5[1] ##	/prefetch:# arguments for the browser process launched in background mode and for the watcher process. Use profiles 5, 6 and 7 as documented on kPrefetchArgument\* in content\_switches.cc. ##

--/prefetch:6[1] ##	No description ##

--/prefetch:8[1] ##	Prefetch arguments are used by the Windows prefetcher to disambiguate different execution modes (i.e. process types) of the same executable image so that different types of processes don't trample each others' prefetch behavior. Legal values are integers in the range [1, 8]. We reserve 8 to mean "whatever", and this will ultimately lead to processes with /prefetch:8 having inconsistent behavior thus disabling prefetch in practice. TODO(rockot): Make it possible for embedders to override this argument on a per-service basis. ##

--10000 ##	No description ##

--100000 ##	No description ##

These keys are available in addition to keys provided by the most recent call to TrustTokenKeyCommitments::Set. For issuers with keys provided through both the command line and TrustTokenKeyCommitments::Set, the keys provided through the command line take precedence. This is because someone testing manually might want to pass additional keys via the command line to a real Chrome release with the component updater enabled, and it would be surprising if the manually-passed keys were overwritten some time after startup when the component updater runs. ##

--agc-startup-min-volume ##	Override the default minimum starting volume of the Automatic Gain Control algorithm in WebRTC used with audio tracks from getUserMedia. The valid range is 12-255.

TODO(https://crbug.com/1060366): Various places in Chrome assume that all profiles are within the user data dir. Some tests need to violate that assumption. The switch should be removed after this workaround is no longer needed. ##

--allow-ra-in-dev-mode ##	Allows remote attestation (RA) in dev mode for testing purpose. Usually RA is disabled in dev mode because it will always fail. However, there are cases in testing where we do want to go through the permission flow even in dev mode. This can be enabled by this flag. ##

--trace-config-file ##	Causes TRACE\_EVENT flags to be recorded from startup. This flag will be ignored if --trace-startup or --trace-shutdown is provided. ##

--trace-startup ##	Causes TRACE\_EVENT flags to be recorded from startup. Optionally, can specify the specific trace categories to include (e.g. --trace-startup=base,net) otherwise, all events are recorded. Setting this flag results in the first call to BeginTracing() to receive all trace events since startup. In Chrome, you may find --trace-startup-file and --trace-startup-duration to control the auto-saving of the trace (not supported in the base-only TraceLog component). ##

--trace-startup-duration ##	Sets the time in seconds until startup tracing ends. If omitted a default of 5 seconds is used. Has no effect without --trace-startup, or if --startup-trace-file=none was supplied. ##

--trace-startup-enable-privacy-filtering ##	If the perfetto tracing backend is used, this enables privacy filtering in the TraceEvent data sources for the startup tracing session. ##

--trace-startup-file ##	If supplied, sets the file which startup tracing will be stored into, if omitted the default will be used "chrometrace.log" in the current directory. Has no effect unless --trace-startup is also supplied. Example: --trace-startup --trace-startup-file=/tmp/trace\_event.log As a special case, can be set to 'none' - this disables automatically saving the result to a file and the first manually recorded trace will then receive all events since startup. ##

--trace-startup-owner ##	Specifies the coordinator of the startup tracing session. If the legacy tracing backend is used instead of perfetto, providing this flag is not necessary. Valid values: 'controller', 'devtools', or 'system'. Defaults to 'controller'. If 'controller' is specified, the session is controlled and stopped via the TracingController (e.g. to implement the timeout). If 'devtools' is specified, the startup tracing session will be owned by DevTools and thus can be controlled (i.e. stopped) via the DevTools Tracing domain on the first session connected to the browser endpoint. If 'system' is specified, the system Perfetto service should already be tracing on a supported platform (currently only Android). Session is stopped through the normal methods for stopping system traces. ##

--trace-startup-record-mode ##	If supplied, sets the tracing record mode and options; otherwise, the default "record-until-full" mode will be used. ##

--trace-to-console ##	Sends a pretty-printed version of tracing info to the console. ##

--trace-to-file ##	Sends trace events from these categories to a file. --trace-to-file on its own sends to default categories. ##

--trusted-cdn-base-url-for-tests[7] ##	Specifies a base URL for the trusted CDN for tests. ##

--trusted-download-sources ##	Identifies a list of download sources as trusted, but only if proper group policy is set. ##

--try-chrome-again ##	Experimental. Shows a dialog asking the user to try chrome. This flag is to be used only by the upgrade process. ##

--try-supported-channel-layouts[1] ##	Instead of always using the hardware channel layout, check if a driver supports the source channel layout. Avoids outputting empty channels and permits drivers to enable stereo to multichannel expansion. Kept behind a flag since some drivers lie about supported layouts and hang when used. See <http://crbug.com/259165> for more details. ##

--tts[5] ##	No description ##

--virtual-time-budget ##	If set the system waits the specified number of virtual milliseconds before deeming the page to be ready. For determinism virtual time does not advance while there are pending network fetches (i.e no timers will fire). Once all network fetches have completed, timers fire and if the system runs out of virtual time is fastforwarded so the next timer fires immediately, until the specified virtual time budget is exhausted. ##

--vmodule ##	Gives the per-module maximal V-logging levels to override the value given by --v. E.g. "my\_module=2,foo\*=3" would change the logging level for all code in source files "my\_module.\*" and "foo\*.\*" ("-inl" suffixes are also disregarded for this matching). Any pattern containing a forward or backward slash will be tested against the whole pathname and not just the module. E.g., "\*/foo/bar/\*=2" would change the logging level for all code in source files under a "foo/bar" directory. ##
